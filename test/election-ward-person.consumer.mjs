// FORGE ELECTION — WARD ASSIGNMENT CANON INTEGRITY  (Loop 34)
//
// Proves the Loop 34 correctness fix, and ONLY that fix. Loop 33 found that
// `wardAssignedEvent`'s own `person` field — accepted by the factory since
// the field was first declared — was silently discarded before it could
// ever become part of the Canon. Reconnaissance for this loop found the
// drop actually happens at TWO points, not one:
//
//   1. `executeElectionWrite()` (studio/write.js) never forwarded a draft's
//      `person` to `wardAssignedEvent()` — so even a caller-populated draft
//      lost it before an event was ever built.
//   2. `projectElection()` (projections.js) never folded `event.person`
//      into `wards[id]` — so even a hand-authored event with `person` set
//      lost it at read time.
//
// Both are fixed together here; fixing only one would leave `person`
// unreachable through the real pipeline (fix #2 alone) or unreadable after
// being reachable (fix #1 alone). Neither fix touches PREPARE
// (`proposeElectionWrite`/`matchWardAssign`) — the natural-language grammar
// still never produces a `person` field (see test J2/B8 in the sibling
// suites, unchanged and still passing), so this is Canon PRESERVATION of
// already-declared event information, never a new write capability, never
// a new event type, and — proven below — never a new readiness dimension.
//
// Run: node test/election-ward-person.consumer.mjs
