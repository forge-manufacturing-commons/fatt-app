// ============================================================
// FORGE STUDIO — UNDERSTANDING  (conversational phase, §4, §8, §25)
//
// THE STAGE THIS PHASE EXISTS TO ADD, and the one that was missing.
//
// Before this file, the model was attached at the wrong end of the pipeline. A
// deterministic phrase table decided what the participant meant, and the model was
// invited afterwards to rephrase the answer more fluently. So Forge could produce a
// beautiful Hausa sentence about the wrong question, and could not understand
// "What is stopping this work?" at all — because the table happens to contain
// "what is blocking" and not "what is stopping". The measured failures were:
//
//   "where is the drawing of hub 002"   component = null   (the id was simply lost)
//   "the 002 hub"                       unknown
//   "CHS 014 status"                    unknown
//   "has fabrication started?"          unknown
//   "Has anyone been assigned to it?"   unknown
//   "What is stopping this work?"       unknown
//
// Adding those six phrasings to the table would have fixed those six sentences and
// nothing else, which is precisely the trap §25 names. The division of labour is
// instead the one §25 sets out:
//
//   THE MODEL       reads the sentence and PROPOSES an operation and an entity
//   THE DETERMINISM validates the proposal, resolves the entity against the fold,
//                   retrieves, grounds, and composes the answer
//
// DETERMINISTIC FIRST, MODEL ON ESCALATION — AND WHY THAT IS NOT A HEDGE.
//
// The phrase table is not deleted. It is demoted to what §12 requires anyway: the
// path that answers when the provider is a 429, a timeout or an unreachable host,
// which in a Nigerian workshop is an ordinary Tuesday rather than an incident. So
// understanding runs deterministically first and consults the model ONLY when the
// deterministic read is genuinely inadequate — an unrecognised intent, or an
// operation that needs a subject and has none. Three consequences, all wanted:
//
//   * a workshop with no connectivity keeps the behaviour it has today
//   * the common questions cost no extra provider call and no extra latency
//   * the model is used exactly where understanding is hard, which is where its
//     value is real and where a table can never catch up
//
// I am naming the trade because it is a real one: a phrase table that matches
// CONFIDENTLY AND WRONGLY will not escalate, and the model never sees that sentence.
// That is why escalation also fires on a missing subject, and why the mutation suite
// includes a mutant that makes the deterministic read always look sufficient.
//
// WHAT THE MODEL CANNOT DO FROM HERE. It returns a request, never a fact — there is
// no claim, no source, no state and no event in the interpret contract. It cannot
// select the response language (§15: that was resolved from the participant's own
// words and the global preference before this file ran). It cannot name an entity
// into existence, because request.js resolves every entity against the fold. And it
// cannot widen its own context: it is given the participant's sentence, the
// operations it may propose, and the ids the Canon actually holds — nothing else,
// and in particular no state, organisation, history or specification content.

 * case, so the participant received "I did not read that as a question Forge Canon can
 * answer" for a question Forge Canon can answer perfectly well. The phrase table was
 * confident and the pipeline was empty.
 *
 * This is the failure mode named in the header of this file, caught by acting as a
 * participant rather than by reading the table — and §18 rules out the tempting fix.
 * Adding "where can I find the drawing" as a marker would have fixed that sentence and
 * left the next one broken, because the defect is not a missing phrase: it is that
 * SUFFICIENCY WAS MEASURED AGAINST RECOGNITION INSTEAD OF AGAINST THE ABILITY TO
 * ANSWER. So sufficiency now requires an intent the responder implements, and any
 * future intent that is recognised before it is answerable escalates instead of
 * producing a shrug.
