// ============================================================
// FORGE ELECTION — CONVERSATIONAL WRITES  (first version)
//
// Business's `write.js` proved the PREPARE -> APPROVAL -> EXECUTE shape;
// this is Election's OWN, much smaller instance of the identical
// architecture, not a copy-paste of Business's code (the entities, phrase
// table, and event factories are Election's own).
//
// FOUR OPERATIONS EXIST, BECAUSE ONLY FOUR ARE JUSTIFIED. Every
// reconnaissance pass against this repository found real, validated
// Election event factories: `candidateEvent`, `wardAssignedEvent`,
// `wardStatusEvent`, and (Loop 29) `observerAssignedEvent`. The observer
// operation earned the same bar the two ward operations already had: it is
// the ONLY way an `observer.assignment.recorded` event can ever be
// written. CANDIDATE REGISTRATION (LOOP 32) earns it too — Loop 31's own
// audit concluded `CANDIDATE_REGISTERED` was already a correctly-derived
// readiness dimension with NO real way for a candidate to ever trigger it
// (only direct test-fixture construction could produce the event); this is
// that gap closed, not a new fact invented. Do not add a further operation
// without the same justification this comment gives for these four.
//
// CANDIDATE REGISTRATION ESTABLISHES ONLY A SELF-DECLARATION, THE SAME
// EPISTEMIC STATUS WARD/OBSERVER ASSIGNMENT ALREADY HAVE. No external
// registry verifies `office`/`constituency`/`party` any more than one
// verifies a ward name or an observer's name — this event means "this
// campaign's Canon contains a candidate registration declaration," never
// "legally eligible," "nominated," "party-approved," or "INEC-registered."
// See events.js's own REQUIRED_ACTOR_KIND entry for this type (declared
// back in Loop 30, unused until now) for the actor-kind gate this
// activation relies on unchanged.
//
// `candidate` (the subject id) IS `campaign` (the tenant id) — not a
// user-suppliable field, not a slug generated from `name`. A campaign in
// this data model already IS one candidate's own campaign (see
// electionBootstrap.js's own reasoning for why `campaigns` exists), and
// `deriveReadiness()` has only ever read `candidates[0]` — there is no
// meaning anywhere in this Canon for a SECOND distinct candidate id inside
// one campaign's log. Reusing `campaign` as `candidate` avoids inventing an
// id-generation scheme with its own edge cases (collisions, slugs) for a
// concept that is already one-per-tenant by construction.
//
// ANCHORED, IMPERATIVE-PREFIX CLASSIFICATION — NOT A SUBSTRING-ANYWHERE
// PHRASE TABLE. Business's own write.js history (Loop 18, Loop 21) found
// repeated collisions from bare substring markers matching ordinary
// questions ("new customer" inside an observation, "complete the task"
// inside "Did I complete the task for Ade?"). Every Election write pattern
// below is anchored to the START of the message ("Assign observer .../
// "Assign .../"Report ..."), which a natural question never is ("Who is
// assigned to Ward 6?", "Is an observer assigned to this polling unit?",
// "What is the report for Ward 6?" all open with an interrogative, never
// with the bare imperative verb) — this closes that collision class by
// construction rather than by a phrase-table blocklist.
//
// OBSERVER-ASSIGN IS CHECKED BEFORE WARD-ASSIGN, DELIBERATELY. "Assign
// observer Jane to Location X" would ALSO satisfy `matchWardAssign`'s
// bare `/^assign\s+(.+?)\s+to\s+(.+?)/` pattern (capturing "observer Jane"
// as an organisation name) if that check ran first — the literal word
// "observer" is what makes the observer pattern the MORE SPECIFIC match,
// so `proposeElectionWrite` tries it first and only falls through to the
// general ward pattern when it does not match. See test S in
// test/election-readiness.consumer.mjs for the collision proof this
// ordering exists to satisfy.
//
// NO MODEL ESCALATION THIS VERSION. `proposeElectionWrite` accepts no
// `interpreter` parameter — only the two deterministic patterns below are
// recognised. Extending this to a model-backed path is future work, not a
// silent gap: the omission is a scope decision (this loop's own brief:
// "DO NOT invent a large collection of election WRITE_OPERATIONs"), stated
// here rather than left to be discovered as a missing feature.
