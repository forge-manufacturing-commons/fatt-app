// ============================================================
// FORGE STUDIO — INFERENCE BOUNDARY  (Phase 1)
//
// The seam where a model will eventually be attached, and nothing more. NO
// provider is chosen, NO key exists, NO network call is made, and nothing here
// imports anything that could reach one.
//
// WHY THE SEAM EXISTS NOW. The safety architecture has to be provable before a
// model is connected, and it can only be proved if a HOSTILE adapter can be
// substituted in a test. So the adapter interface comes first and the deterministic
// implementation comes with it; the real one is Phase 2, on authorisation.
//
// THE CONTRACT AN ADAPTER MUST OBEY:
//
//   adapter({ intent, canon, language }) -> claim[]
//
// An adapter returns CLAIMS, never prose and never actions. It therefore cannot:
//   * publish an event      — it has no publish, no emitter, no bus
//   * write to the Canon    — the projection it receives is deep-frozen
//   * grant authority       — it has no identity, role, capability or policy
//   * be trusted            — every claim it returns is re-verified downstream
//
// A hostile adapter is not a security hole in this design; it is a test case.
// `runInference` grounds whatever comes back, so an adapter that lies produces
// UNKNOWN rather than a fact. That property is what Phase 1 exists to prove.
