// ============================================================
// FORGE STUDIO — CONVERSATION  (conversational phase, §6, §7, §17)
//
// A participant should be able to type an identifier ONCE:
//
//   "What is the status of CHS-014?"   -> subject established
//   "Why?"                            -> same subject
//   "Who is responsible for it?"       -> same subject
//   "Where is it?"                     -> same subject
//   "What about inspection?"           -> same subject
//   "Prepare the inspection pass."     -> same subject
//
// WHAT A CONVERSATION IS ALLOWED TO BE, AND WHY THE LIMIT IS THE DESIGN.
//
// A conversation carries EXACTLY ONE KIND OF THING FORWARD: which Canon entities
// have been named. It does not carry facts, states, answers, provenance or
// authority. That restriction is not tidiness — it is the security property. If a
// conversation could carry a fact, then "CHS-014 has passed inspection" typed by a
// participant in turn 1 would be available as context in turn 2, and the difference
// between "the Canon records this" and "somebody said this earlier" would come down
// to whether a later layer remembered to check. Here the question cannot arise: the
// only thing memory can produce is an IDENTIFIER, and an identifier is worthless
// until the fold is read. `grounding.fromConversation` exists for the same reason
// one level down.
//
// AMBIGUITY IS RECORDED PER TURN, NOT PER CONVERSATION. A turn that named two
// entities put two entities in play; a later bare "it" is then genuinely ambiguous
// and §7 requires Forge to ask. This is why `subjects` is an array on every turn:
// with only a single `lastComponent`, a two-entity sentence silently collapsed to
// one subject and the clarification path could never fire. Dead safety code reads
// exactly like working safety code, which is the more expensive kind of bug.
//
// NOTHING HERE IS PERSISTED. There is no localStorage, no Supabase table, no
// IndexedDB and no cache — §26 lists persistent conversation storage as a STOP
// condition and this phase does not have that authorisation. A reload is a new
// conversation, and the Canon is entirely unaffected by either.

/**
 * The subjects in play: those of the MOST RECENT TURN THAT NAMED ANY.
 *
 * NOT THE UNION ACROSS THE WINDOW, AND THE DIFFERENCE IS THE WHOLE BEHAVIOUR.
 *
 * The union was the first implementation and the suite killed it three ways at once:
 *
 *   * §23 ENTITY CONFUSION BROKE. "What is the status of CHS-014?" then "What about
 *     HUB-002?" then "Where is it?" — under a union, both parts were in play, so a
 *     perfectly clear switch became an ambiguity and Forge asked a question the
 *     participant had already answered by naming HUB-002.
 *   * A RESOLVED AMBIGUITY CAME BACK FROM THE DEAD. Forge asks "CHS-014 or HUB-002?",
 *     the participant answers "HUB-002", and the very next "Where is it?" was
 *     ambiguous again — because the older two-subject turn was still inside the
 *     window. Being asked the same question twice after answering it is worse than
 *     not being asked at all.
 *   * IT MADE AMBIGUITY THE DEFAULT for any conversation that ranged over two parts,
 *     which would have trained participants to always type the id — the exact
 *     behaviour this phase exists to remove.
 *
 * "The last thing mentioned" is what a person means by "it", and it is also
 * self-correcting: naming one part is all it takes to clear any earlier confusion.
 * §7 still fires exactly when it should, because a turn that named TWO parts is the
 * most recent subject-bearing turn until something else is named.
 *
 * `window` still bounds how far back the search goes, so a subject cannot be carried
 * out of a conversation that has plainly moved on.

 * sentence — it means "the question I just asked, about this part instead", and a
 * participant who has to retype "What is the status of HUB-002?" has learned that
 * Forge is not really following the conversation.
 *
 * This is a RULE, not a phrase. It adds no marker to any table and works for any
 * wording in any language that names an entity without asking anything — which is why
 * it belongs here rather than as five more entries per language in intent.js.
 *
 * UNKNOWN and ACTION_REQUEST are deliberately not carriable. Carrying UNKNOWN
