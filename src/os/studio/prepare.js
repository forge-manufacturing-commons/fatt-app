// FORGE STUDIO — PREPARE  (Phase 2)
//
// The third mode, and the only one that produces something shaped like an action.
// It produces an OBJECT. It does not produce an effect.
//
// WHAT PREPARE IS FOR. A workshop participant who has just told Forge AI, in
// Hausa, that a part passed inspection should not then have to hunt through a
// form. Forge AI can assemble the record. What it must never do is finish the
// job, because the entire authority architecture of ForgeOS lives in the step it
// would be skipping.
//
// THREE THINGS ARE DELIBERATELY MISSING FROM EVERY DRAFT, AND THEIR ABSENCE IS
// THE POINT:
//
//   eventId   assigned by the emitter, not by a caller. A draft with an id would
//             look like an event that already exists.
//   at        stamped when the event is actually recorded. A draft carries no
//             claim about when anything happened.
//   person    the AUTHENTICATED operator. This is the important one: if a draft
//             could name its own operator, a conversational assertion ("I am the
//             engineer") would become an attribution, and attribution is what the
//             policy gates check. So the draft leaves the actor blank and says so.
//
// This module imports NO emitter, NO policy, and NO publish. It cannot record an
// event even if every check above it were removed — there is nothing here to call.
// The test suite asserts that by reading this file's imports, not by trusting this
// comment.
