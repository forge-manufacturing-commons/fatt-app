// ============================================================
// FORGE STUDIO — ENTITY RESOLUTION  (conversational phase, §5)
//
// "hub 002", "HUB 002", "hub-002", "Hub-002", "the 002 hub" and "HUB-002" are the
// same part. A participant types whichever one their thumbs produce, and Forge has
// to understand all of them without the participant learning a syntax.
//
// THE RULE THAT MAKES THIS SAFE, AND THE REASON THIS FILE IS SHORT:
// RESOLUTION IS DRIVEN BY THE CANON, NOT BY A PATTERN LIBRARY.
//
// Nothing here knows that component ids look like `XXX-999`. It reads the ids the
// Canon ACTUALLY HOLDS — `Object.keys(view.components)`, the specification keys, the
// mission ids — and asks a much narrower question: does this message name one of
// them? So the resolvable set is exactly the set of things that exist. A model, a
// participant or a future bug proposing "HUB-999" gets nothing back, because
// "HUB-999" is not in the Canon and there is no code path here that could mint it.
//
// That is also why this is NOT the "dozens of hardcoded regexes" §5 rules out. There
// is one normalisation and one comparison. Adding a component to the Canon makes it
// resolvable; adding a naming convention costs nothing here.
//
// AMBIGUITY IS AN OUTCOME, NOT A COIN FLIP. When a message could mean two Canon
// entities, `resolveEntity` returns them BOTH and resolves nothing. §7 requires
// Forge to ask rather than guess, and it can only ask if this layer refuses to
// decide. A resolver that silently picked the first match would make the
// clarification path dead code — and dead safety code reads exactly like working
// safety code.
