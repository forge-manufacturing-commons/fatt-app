// ============================================================
// FORGE STUDIO — THE SEMANTIC REQUEST LAYER  (conversational phase, §9)
//
// The narrow doorway between "the model understood the sentence" and "Forge reads
// the Canon". A model may PROPOSE a request:
//
//   { intent: "component.responsibility", entity: "CHS-014" }
//
// and this file decides whether that proposal is a thing Forge will do. It is the
// same architectural move as `validateEvent` at the kernel boundary: the proposer is
// untrusted, the shape is checked, and an unrecognised value is a rejection rather
// than a best guess.
//
// FOUR REASONS THIS IS A SEPARATE FILE AND NOT AN `if` INSIDE THE ADAPTER:
//
// 1. THE ALLOWLIST IS THE CAPABILITY CEILING. A model can only ever propose one of
//    the operations named below, and every one of them is a READ. There is no
//    proposable operation that publishes, approves, transfers responsibility or
//    changes state — not because the prompt asks the model not to, but because no
//    such name exists in this map for it to return. An operation Forge does not
//    perform cannot be requested into existence by a fluent sentence.
//
// 2. THE INTERNAL NAMES NEVER LEAK. `component.responsibility` is vocabulary for
//    this boundary. §7 and §20 forbid showing a participant `AMBIGUOUS_ENTITY` or
//    `COMPONENT_STATUS`, so these strings are carried on the result for tests and
//    the provenance panel and are never realised into a sentence.
//
// 3. UNKNOWN MEANS REJECTED, NOT NEAREST. A proposal of "component.materials" is
//    refused outright. Coercing it to the closest known intent is how a model's
//    misunderstanding becomes Forge's confident wrong answer, and the coercion would
//    be invisible in the result.
//
// 4. AN ENTITY IS VALIDATED AGAINST THE FOLD, NEVER ACCEPTED ON THE MODEL'S WORD.
//    entity.js does the resolving and it can only ever return an id the Canon holds.
//    A proposal naming "HUB-999" therefore yields UNRESOLVED_ENTITY, and Forge says
//    it has no record — which is true — instead of answering about a part that does
//    not exist.
// ============================================================

/**
 * Every operation a model may propose, mapped to the canonical intent it becomes.
 *
 * THE LEFT-HAND SIDE IS SEMANTIC VOCABULARY; THE RIGHT-HAND SIDE IS FORGE CANON.
 * Several names map to one intent on purpose — "component.location" and
 * "component.hub" are the same read, and a model that reaches for either is
 * understood. That is aliasing at the boundary, which is cheap, and it is NOT the
 * phrase dictionary §25 rules out: these are a dozen stable operation names, not an
 * open-ended and ever-growing list of the ways a human might word a question. The
 * wording is the model's problem. The operation is Forge's.
 *
 * NOTE WHAT IS ABSENT. There is no `component.approve`, `component.publish`,
 * `event.record`, `responsibility.transfer` or `state.set`. The eight open questions
 * in §8 all land on reads that already existed before this phase — which is the
 * payoff of the four-relationships design rather than a coincidence.
