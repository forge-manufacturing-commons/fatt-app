// ============================================================
// FORGE STUDIO — CANONICAL INTENT  (Phase 0)
//
// Language is an input/output layer. Meaning is not.
//
//   "What should I do next with HUB-014?"          en
//   "Me ya kamata in yi na gaba akan HUB-014?"     ha
//   "Kí ni mo yẹ kí n ṣe tókàn lori HUB-014?"      yo
//   "Gịnị ka m kwesịrị ime ọzọ na HUB-014?"        ig
//
// ...all resolve to ONE canonical intent:
//
//   { type: "component.next_action", component: "HUB-014", language, confidence }
//
// There is deliberately NO per-language business logic. Each intent declares
// marker phrases per language and the resolution code is shared, so adding a
// language means adding phrases — never a second implementation, and never a
// second copy of the manufacturing rules.
//
// ENTITIES COME FROM THE PROTECTED-TERM LAYER. A component or specification id is
// extracted by the same mechanism that stops it being translated, so the entity
// the intent names and the token the translator must preserve are guaranteed to
// be the same string.
//
// PHASE 0 IS RECOGNITION, NOT ACTION. An intent is a question the Canon can be
// asked. It carries no authority, publishes nothing, and an unrecognised message
// is `unknown` rather than a guess.

/**
 * Every intent Forge Studio recognises.
 *
 * PHASE 2 ADDED SIX, AND EVERY ONE OF THEM IS STILL A READ. The additions exist
 * because the Canon already holds four DISTINCT relationships on a component and
 * a single "who?" intent could not tell them apart:
 *
 *   COMPONENT_WHO           RESPONSIBILITY   component.organisation
 *   COMPONENT_CONTRIBUTIONS PARTICIPATION    component.contributions[]
 *   COMPONENT_DIRECTIVES    COORDINATION     component.directives[]
 *   COMPONENT_HISTORY       PERFORMANCE      component.history[]
 *
 * Collapsing those into one intent would have made Forge AI answer "who is
 * responsible?" with a list of contributors — reintroducing exactly the confusion
 * E9 was built to remove. So the language layer distinguishes them, because the
 * Canon does.
 *
 * ACTION_REQUEST is the one that is NOT a question. It exists so that "approve
 * this" is RECOGNISED rather than falling through to `unknown` — a request to act
 * must be identified in order to be refused with a reason. Recognising an
 * instruction is not obeying it.

  // THE TIE-BREAK WAS BROKEN AND IS NOW FIXED. It read `h[1] === b[0]`, indexing a
  // hit OBJECT numerically — `h[1]` is always undefined, so the filter never
  // matched, `Math.max(...[], 0)` was always 0, and every tie silently fell back to
  // Map insertion order. It went unnoticed while there were seven intents that
  // rarely tied. With fourteen that share "who" and "where" vocabulary, an
  // insertion-order tie-break would make the answer depend on the order this file
  // happens to declare its intents, which is not a linguistic fact about the
  // question. Longest single matched phrase now decides.
