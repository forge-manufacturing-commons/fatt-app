// ============================================================
// FORGE STUDIO — THE PIPELINE  (Phase 2)
//
// One function the room calls, and the only place the stages are wired together:
//
//   message
//     -> detect language          language.js
//     -> resolve canonical intent intent.js
//     -> read Forge Canon         canonTools.js  (deep-frozen, read-only)
//     -> produce claims           infer.js       (adapter — UNTRUSTED)
//     -> verify every claim       grounding.js   (second security boundary)
//     -> realise in the language  respond.js
//
// THE ORDER IS THE SECURITY MODEL. Verification sits between the thing that
// produces claims and the thing that speaks them, so no adapter — deterministic,
// remote, hostile, or a future model with a persuasive tone — can reach the
// sentence without passing the fold. Swapping the adapter cannot reorder this.
//
// MODE is a capability ceiling, not a hint:
//   ASK      read the Canon and answer.
//   EXPLAIN  the same facts plus the interpretation the Canon's own state
//            machine supplies. Still read.
//   PREPARE  additionally return a DRAFT event object. Not published, not
//            authorised, not validated against policy. See prepare.js.
//
// Nothing in this file imports an emitter, a policy, `publish`, Supabase, or any
// room-local module. That is checked by the test suite rather than promised here.

 * @param session            prior turns, for resolving "the component we discussed".

 * @param interpreter        optional model-backed understanding (understand.js).
