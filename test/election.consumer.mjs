// FORGE ELECTION — DOMAIN-PLURALITY PROOF  (MVP domain pack)
//
// The question this suite answers: does the SAME Forge Core — one AI engine,
// one conversation memory, one Canon-fold pattern, one grounding pass, one
// language runtime, one authority engine — serve a second domain without
// becoming a second application?
//
// It proves that by NEVER importing a second `understand`, a second
// `runInference`, a second `groundResponse`, or a second `SEGMENT` — every
// import below with "../src/os/studio/" in its path is the SAME module
// manufacturing's own consumer suites import, and Election supplies only
// DATA (its own intent table, adapter switch, response wording) over that
// SAME shared algorithm.
//
// Run: node test/election.consumer.mjs
