// ============================================================
// FORGE ELECTION — WEB (SESSION-AUTHENTICATED CHANNEL) ADAPTER  (Loop 26)
//
// The FIRST real caller of the Loop 25 activation boundary
// (src/os/electionContext.js). Thin on purpose: every function here does
// exactly two things — (1) turn a real, injected Supabase client's OWN
// session into a `userId` never taken from a request body, and (2) call
// straight into the already-tested domain boundary (electionContext.js,
// electionScope.js, write.js) with it. No election fact, no readiness
// value, and no scope decision is computed HERE — this file only ever
// forwards to functions Loops 22-25 already proved.
//
// WHY THIS IS "WEB", BUT IMPORTS NO REACT. `ForgeBusinessAssistantRoom.jsx`
// is this repository's own existing channel-adapter precedent: it reads
// `useIdentity()`'s `user.id` (itself sourced from
// `supabase.auth.getSession()`, never a prop or a request body) and hands
// it to `resolveBusinessScope({userId, client: supabase})`. This module is
// that SAME pattern, one layer lower and channel-agnostic: instead of
// trusting a caller to have already extracted `user.id` from a React hook,
// it extracts it itself via `client.auth.getUser()` — the actual Supabase
// call that verifies a session's JWT server-side. A future WhatsApp
// adapter, given a Supabase client bound to a verified session by whatever
// means THAT channel authenticates, calls the exact same functions below
// unchanged — nothing here assumes a browser, a cookie, or React state.
//
// AUTHENTICATION AUTHORITY, STATED PLAINLY. `getAuthenticatedUserId()` is
// the ONLY source of `userId` anywhere in this file. No exported function
// accepts a `userId` parameter — there is nothing for a hostile request
// body, a model, or a stale prop to inject. If `client.auth.getUser()`
// disagrees, there is no `userId` to fall back to.
