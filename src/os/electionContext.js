// ============================================================
// FORGE ELECTION — ACTIVATION BOUNDARY  (Loop 25)
//
// The ONE channel-neutral entry point through which a campaign is created,
// its owner established, its scope resolved, and its Canon read — reusable
// unchanged by ForgeOS, a future WhatsApp channel, an independent web app,
// or an Edge Function. It assumes NOTHING about the caller except that it
// supplies an authenticated `userId` and an injected `client` — no React,
// no browser session, no conversation memory, no AI provider, no model.
//
// THIS FILE COMPOSES, IT DOES NOT REPLACE. `bootstrapCampaign()`
// (electionBootstrap.js) and `resolveElectionScope()` (electionScope.js)
// are UNCHANGED by this loop — this module calls them, in the order Loop
// 25's own brief specifies, and adds no third way to create a campaign or
// resolve scope. `projectElection()`/`deriveReadiness()` are equally
// unchanged; this module's only new contribution is the ONE missing wire:
// pulling a campaign's real persisted rows out of `election_events` so
// those two pure functions have something live to fold, mirroring the
// exact `fetchLog()`/`.map((r) => r.payload)` pattern
// `ForgeBusinessAssistantRoom.jsx` already uses for Business — extracted
// here so Election never needs a room to read its own Canon.
//
// WHY BOOTSTRAP'S OWN RETURN VALUE IS NEVER TRUSTED. Loop 24's CBOOT-8
// already proved `bootstrapCampaign()`'s success does not itself grant
// scope — only a real `campaign_members` row does. `activateElectionCampaign()`
// below keeps that discipline at this layer too: after bootstrap succeeds,
// it calls `resolveElectionScope()` AGAIN, independently, and reports
// failure if that independent check disagrees. A campaign is never
// reported as usable because bootstrap SAID so; only because the
// membership table, re-read, agrees.

 * check, because the parameter simply does not exist: a caller-supplied
 * `view`, a caller-supplied `readiness`, a caller-supplied candidate/ward
 * fact, or any conversation/session object. The ONLY inputs are an
 * identity, a client, and an optional campaign hint — exactly
 * resolveElectionScope()'s own `requested` semantics, so a hostile or
 * model-supplied campaign id here is refused for the identical reason it
 * is refused there (see test A3/A4/A8).
 *
 * ACTOR-KIND GATING (LOOP 28, EXTENDED LOOP 29) — AN HONEST REFUSAL, OR THE
 * RIGHT SIBLING ENGINE, NEVER A SECOND CANON. `deriveReadiness()`'s three
 * candidate-specific dimensions and `deriveObserverReadiness()`'s one
 * observer-specific dimension are each called ONLY for the actor kind they
 * were built for — reading a `candidate.registered`/`campaign.ward.*` event
 * log means something genuinely different from an
 * `observer.assignment.recorded` one, and neither engine gains awareness of
 * the other's vocabulary. Every OTHER declared actor kind (NGO, monitoring
 * group, campaign support organisation, security/coordination organisation)
 * still has no authoritative event anywhere (Loop 28/29's own
 * reconnaissance found none), so this function refuses honestly for them:
 * `readiness: null`, `unsupportedActorKind: true`. This is NOT either
 * readiness engine gaining actor-kind awareness — both remain exactly as
 * pure and single-purpose as they always were; the ROUTING happens here,
 * one layer up, before either is ever called.
