// FORGE OS — CANONICAL DESIGN SYSTEM
//
// Immutable design tokens. This is a SPECIFICATION, not a preference.
// Every room, panel, badge and chart derives from here. Rooms must not
// declare their own colours — six rooms previously each re-declared the
// palette, which is precisely how three competing palettes came to exist
// in one codebase.
//
// If a value is not in this file, it is not a Forge colour.
