// ============================================================
// FORGE ELECTION — DETERMINISTIC ADAPTER  (MVP domain pack)
//
// The SAME CONTRACT os/studio/infer.js's ADAPTER_CONTRACT publishes:
//
//   adapter({ intent, canon, tools, language }) -> claim[]
//
// This is Election's own instance of that contract, not a second inference
// engine. `runInference` (os/studio/infer.js) is imported and used AS-IS by
// ask.js for every domain — grounding, re-verification and the untrusted-input
// treatment of whatever this function returns are identical for Election and
// for manufacturing, because it is the SAME function, called with a different
// `adapter`.
//
// Every claim constructor (canonFact, interpretation, recommendation, unknown,
// foldSource) is imported from the CORE grounding.js — Election declares no
// claim class of its own, and cites the SAME dotted fold-path convention
// (`wards.Ward 7.status`) that grounding.js's `resolveFoldPath` already knows
// how to walk against WHATEVER view shape it is given.
